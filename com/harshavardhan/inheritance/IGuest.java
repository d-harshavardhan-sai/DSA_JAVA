//Multiple Inheritance
// main difference between class and interface is 
// we provide implementation for every method in the class
// But in interface we don't provide any implementation for methods

// we can also do like multi-level inheritance in interface also.

        // class - multi-level
        // interface - both multi-level and multiple inheritance
