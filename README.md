## 🏁 How to Practice

1. **Read the problem** - Understand the constraints and the goal.
2. **Start simple** - Try recursion first, then introduce memoization or tabulation.
3. **Track patterns** - Notice the subproblem relationships, form your 'state'.
4. **Optimize** - Always check if your solution can be made more efficient.

---

## 📚 Quick DP Concepts

- **State:** What defines your subproblem? (e.g., steps, index, choices)
- **Transition:** How do previous states build the solution?
- **Base Case:** When does DP stop recurring or iterating?
- **Memoization/Tabulation:** Store answers to avoid recalculation.

### 🥇 Pro Tip

Try each problem in both recursive (top-down) and iterative (bottom-up) versions.  
Compare their space and time efficiency.
